# Tensors, Arrays, and Vectors

## What are “tensors?”
Tensors are closely related to arrays, and often in discussions about machine learning, the terms tensor, array, and matrix are used interchangeably. However, there are subtle differences between them, typically related to context or the attributes of a tensor object. To understand tensors, let’s first delve into some of the other data structures commonly encountered in programming.

### Lists in Go
In Go, a list-like structure is usually represented by a slice. A slice is defined as a sequence of elements of a particular type. For example, you can have a simple slice of integers:

```go
l := []int{1, 5, 6, 2}
```

You can also create a slice of slices, similar to a matrix:

```go
lol := [][]int{
    {1, 5, 6, 2},
    {3, 2, 1, 3},
}
```

And even a slice of slices of slices:

```go
lolol := [][][]int{
    {
        {1, 5, 6, 2},
        {3, 2, 1, 3},
    },
    {
        {5, 2, 1, 2},
        {6, 4, 8, 4},
    },
    {
        {2, 8, 5, 3},
        {1, 1, 9, 4},
    },
}
```

All of the above could also be considered arrays or even representations of tensors. A slice in Go is very flexible, allowing for dynamic resizing. However, to represent mathematical concepts like matrices or tensors, we usually need more structure.

## Arrays and Homogeneity
An **array** is a data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Unlike slices, arrays in Go have a fixed length:

```go
array := [4]int{1, 5, 6, 2}
```

An array of arrays (2D array) is commonly used to represent matrices:

```go
matrix := [2][3]int{
    {4, 2, 3},
    {5, 1, 2},
}
```

To qualify as an array, it must be **homologous**, meaning that each sub-array along a dimension must have the same length. For example, the following would **not** be valid as an array:

```go
invalidMatrix := [][]int{
    {4, 2, 3},
    {5, 1},
}
```

This is because the sub-arrays do not have equal lengths (3 and 2). While Go would allow this as a slice of slices, it would not be considered a proper 2-dimensional array.

### Matrices
A **matrix** is a 2-dimensional array. It has rows and columns and is often used in mathematical computations. For example:

```go
matrix := [3][2]int{
    {4, 2},
    {5, 1},
    {8, 2},
}
```

This 3x2 matrix has 3 rows and 2 columns. The shape of this array is denoted as `(3, 2)`, indicating its dimensions.

### 3D Arrays
With 3-dimensional arrays, we introduce a third level of nested structures:

```go
threeDArray := [3][2][4]int{
    {
        {1, 5, 6, 2},
        {3, 2, 1, 3},
    },
    {
        {5, 2, 1, 2},
        {6, 4, 8, 4},
    },
    {
        {2, 8, 5, 3},
        {1, 1, 9, 4},
    },
}
```

In this example, the outermost array contains 3 matrices (2D arrays), each matrix contains 2 lists, and each list contains 4 elements. The shape of this 3-dimensional array is `(3, 2, 4)`.

## Tensors in Deep Learning
In the context of deep learning, the term **tensor** is often used. While a tensor is not simply an array, it can be **represented** as an array in code, especially in Go and other programming languages. The core idea is:

> A tensor object is an object that can be represented as an array.

In practical terms, this means that we can manipulate tensors using array-like structures in Go, such as slices and arrays. The differences between tensors and arrays are more about the conceptual framework and less about how they are represented in code.

## Vectors
A **vector** is a simpler form of an array — essentially a 1-dimensional array. In mathematics, a vector is a list of numbers. In Go, this would look like:

```go
vector := []int{1, 2, 3}
```

Vectors are often treated as lists, but in the context of machine learning, they represent points or directions in space. Mathematically, vectors are treated as a sequence of numbers enclosed in brackets.

### Vector Operations: Dot Product and Addition
One of the fundamental operations in neural networks is the **dot product**. A dot product is the sum of the products of corresponding elements of two vectors. In Go, we can compute the dot product like this:

```go
a := []int{1, 2, 3}
b := []int{2, 3, 4}
dotProduct := 0

for i := range a {
    dotProduct += a[i] * b[i]
}
fmt.Println(dotProduct) // Output: 20
```

In this example, we multiply elements from `a` and `b` at the same indices and sum the results, which gives us the dot product.

Another important operation is **vector addition**, which is done element-wise:

```go
c := make([]int, len(a))
for i := range a {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
}
fmt.Println(c) // Output: [3 5 7]
```

Both vectors need to have the same size for element-wise addition to work, and the result is a vector of the same size.

## A Single Neuron with Go
Let's code a simple neuron using the dot product in Go. Assume we have `inputs` and `weights` as vectors, and we want to calculate the output of a neuron:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    inputs := []float64{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}
    weights := []float64{0.2, 0.8, -0.5}
    bias := 2.0

    output := 0.0
    for i := range inputs {
        output += inputs[i] * weights[i]
    }
    output += bias

    fmt.Println("Output:", output)
}
```

In this example, we calculate the weighted sum of the inputs and add the bias, which simulates the operation of a neuron in a neural network.
